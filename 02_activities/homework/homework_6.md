**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.

Reflecting on my previous work as a lecturer, I recognize the importance of integrating ethics and inequity components into the curriculum to better prepare students for the complexities of the modern world. In my experience, education often focuses heavily on technical skills and theoretical knowledge, sometimes overlooking the broader societal implications of the material being taught. 

I believe, fostering an inclusive classroom environment is essential. I would strive to create a space where all students feel valued and encouraged to share their perspectives. This could involve diversifying the course materials and projects to include voices and contributions from historically underrepresented groups in the field. By doing so, students can appreciate the contributions of diverse individuals and understand the inequities that may exist within the discipline.

Furthermore, I would actively seek student feedback on course content and teaching methods to ensure that all voices are heard and valued. By creating an open dialogue about their experiences and perspectives, I can better understand the challenges students may face and adapt my teaching to meet their needs. This iterative approach to course design would enable me to continually refine my curriculum, ensuring that it remains relevant and inclusive.

In conclusion, by reflecting on my previous experiences as a lecturer, I recognize the vital role that ethics and equity play in education. Moving forward, I am committed to incorporating these components into my teaching practices. By fostering an inclusive environment, integrating diverse perspectives, and actively seeking student input, I hope to equip my students with the skills and mindset necessary to navigate the complex ethical landscape of their future careers in engineering.
